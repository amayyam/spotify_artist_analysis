Sure! Here’s how we can break down the assignment:

1. Using the Spotify API:
First, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and register an app to get credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
You can use the spotifyr package in R or the spotipy package in Python to interact with the Spotify API.
Decide on the group or artist of interest (e.g., analyze songs, albums, genres, or audio features).
2. Downloading Data:
Use the API to download information like track details, popularity, audio features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability), or playlist data.
Example queries might be for a particular artist, genre, or playlist.
3. Analysis in R or Python:
Analyze the data you've retrieved. Some ideas:
Compare track popularity over time.
Analyze trends in audio features (like tempo or danceability).
Group analysis by genre or release year.
You can use packages like ggplot2 in R or matplotlib/seaborn in Python for visualizations.
4. Writing the Paper with Quarto:
Structure the paper into sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
Include visualizations or tables summarizing your analysis.
Add references for sources, including the Spotify API and any other materials.
5. GitHub Repo:
Create a well-structured repo that includes:
The R or Python code used for analysis.
The Quarto document (.qmd) that generates the final paper.
Any additional files (like README.md or appendices).
I can help with the specific steps or code if you’d like. Do you know what group or artist you'd like to focus on?

Got it! Here's how we can adapt everything for Radiohead, focusing on an interesting analysis of their tracks. For Radiohead, we can analyze their audio features (like mood and complexity), album evolution over time, or even compare the popularity of songs with their artistic experimentation.

1. Spotify API Data for Radiohead:
Using the Spotify API, you can access similar types of data for Radiohead as you would for Taylor Swift:

Track Information: Track name, album, release date, popularity, and duration.
Audio Features: Acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence (happiness), etc.
Albums: Album names, release dates, and track counts.
An interesting analysis could be:

Evolution of Audio Features: How Radiohead’s sound changed over the years in terms of mood (valence), complexity (instrumentalness), and energy.
Popularity vs. Experimentation: How track popularity relates to their audio features, especially for more experimental tracks like from Kid A or In Rainbows.
2. Script for Data Downloading (01-data_download.R):
This R script will fetch Radiohead’s data.

r
Copy code
# Install spotifyr if not already installed
# install.packages('spotifyr')

library(spotifyr)
library(dplyr)

# Authenticate (make sure to set up your Spotify app credentials)
client_id <- 'your-client-id'
client_secret <- 'your-client-secret'
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token(client_id, client_secret)

# Get Radiohead's artist ID
artist <- get_artist("Radiohead")

# Get Radiohead's albums
radiohead_albums <- get_artist_albums(artist$id, include_groups = 'album')

# Get tracks and audio features from their albums
get_tracks_audio_features <- function(album_id) {
  tracks <- get_album_tracks(album_id)
  audio_features <- get_track_audio_features(tracks$id)
  
  track_data <- tracks %>%
    select(id, name, track_number, duration_ms, popularity) %>%
    left_join(audio_features, by = "id")
  
  return(track_data)
}

# Download data for all albums
radiohead_data <- bind_rows(lapply(radiohead_albums$id, get_tracks_audio_features))

# Save the data to a CSV file
write.csv(radiohead_data, "radiohead_tracks_audio_features.csv", row.names = FALSE)
3. Data Cleaning Script (02-data_cleaning.R):
This script cleans the data for analysis.

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
radiohead_data <- read.csv('radiohead_tracks_audio_features.csv')

# Convert duration from ms to minutes
radiohead_data <- radiohead_data %>%
  mutate(duration_min = duration_ms / 60000)

# Select relevant columns for analysis
cleaned_radiohead_data <- radiohead_data %>%
  select(name, album_name, track_number, duration_min, popularity, acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence, tempo)

# Save cleaned data
write.csv(cleaned_radiohead_data, "cleaned_radiohead_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
4. Interesting Analyses for Radiohead:
Here are a couple of ideas for analysis:

Analysis 1: Evolution of Radiohead’s Sound Over Time

We’ll analyze how Radiohead’s sound evolved across albums, focusing on valence (mood), instrumentalness (complexity), and energy.

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Load the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- read.csv('cleaned_radiohead_data.csv')

# Plot valence (mood) across albums
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = album_name, y = valence, color = album_name)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Valence (Mood) of Radiohead Tracks by Album",
       x = "Album", y = "Valence (Happiness)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Save plot
ggsave('valence_by_album.png')

# Plot instrumentalness (complexity) across albums
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = album_name, y = instrumentalness, color = album_name)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Instrumentalness (Complexity) of Radiohead Tracks by Album",
       x = "Album", y = "Instrumentalness") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

# Save plot
ggsave('instrumentalness_by_album.png')
Analysis 2: Popularity vs Experimentation

We’ll explore how Radiohead’s popularity correlates with more experimental features like instrumentalness or valence (Radiohead tends to be less “happy” in mood).

r
Copy code
# Scatter plot: Popularity vs Instrumentalness
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = instrumentalness, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Popularity vs Instrumentalness of Radiohead Tracks",
       x = "Instrumentalness", y = "Popularity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save plot
ggsave('popularity_vs_instrumentalness.png')

# Scatter plot: Popularity vs Valence
ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = valence, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Popularity vs Valence (Mood) of Radiohead Tracks",
       x = "Valence", y = "Popularity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save plot
ggsave('popularity_vs_valence.png')

## Introduction

Radiohead is known for its evolving sound and artistic experimentation. This paper explores their evolution across albums using Spotify's audio feature data. We focus on how Radiohead's mood, complexity, and energy have changed over time, as well as how their experimental sound correlates with track popularity.

## Methods

We used the Spotify API to download audio features and track information for Radiohead’s discography. The data was analyzed using R, focusing on key audio features like valence (happiness), instrumentalness (complexity), and popularity.

## Results

### Evolution of Sound

The following plot shows how the valence (mood) of Radiohead’s tracks has evolved across albums:

```{r}
# Insert the plot for valence by album
Additionally, we examined how their complexity (instrumentalness) has varied:

{r}
Copy code
# Insert the plot for instrumentalness by album
Popularity and Experimentation
Next, we analyzed the relationship between track popularity and experimentation (instrumentalness and mood). The following scatter plots show this relationship:

{r}
Copy code
# Insert popularity vs instrumentalness plot
{r}
Copy code
# Insert popularity vs valence plot
Conclusion

From this analysis, we observe that Radiohead's sound has become more complex and less conventional over time, especially in terms of instrumentalness and mood. Interestingly, their more experimental tracks do not always correlate with higher popularity, highlighting the band's artistic choices over commercial appeal.

what does row.names = false do
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The argument row.names = FALSE in write.csv() (or similar functions) prevents R from writing row numbers to the CSV file. By default, when you export a dataframe to a CSV in R, it adds an extra column that contains the row indices (the row numbers) even if your data does not originally have such a column. Setting row.names = FALSE disables this behavior, ensuring that no extra column with row numbers is included in the exported CSV file.

So, the resulting CSV will contain only the data columns you explicitly specify.
